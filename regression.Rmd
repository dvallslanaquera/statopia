# General Linear Model 


# Poisson Model

For modelling the number of times an event occurs in an interval of time or space.
like number of people, number of cases, and so forth. 

To create our model we will use the total number of roadkills of amphibious 
along a roadway in Portugal (Zuur et al. 2013).
We will take one explanatory variable into account for our analysis. We want to
associate the distance to a park with the number of total roadkills (D.PARK).

```{r echo=FALSE}
RK <- read.table("C:/Users/David/Desktop/statopia.github.io/statopia/RoadKills.txt", header = TRUE)

plot(RK$D.PARK, RK$TOT.N, 
     xlab = "Distance to the park", ylab = "Roadkills")
```
```{r}
knitr::kable(RK[1:10,])
```

The data clearly presents a **Poisson distribution**. 

## 1. Creation of the GLM model

```{r}
M1 <- glm(TOT.N ~ D.PARK, family = poisson, data = RK) 
summary(M1)
100 * (1071.4 - 390.9)/ 1071.4
```

The slope and the intercept of the model are statistically significants (p < 0.001).
The AIC value is 634.29 (we'll need it to compare it with other models in the future).
We can explain a 63% of the variance with our GLM model. 

## 2. Plotting the model

```{r}
MyData <- data.frame(D.PARK = seq(from = 0, to = 25000, by = 1000))
G <- predict(M1, newdata = MyData, type = "link", se = TRUE)
Fi <- exp(G$fit)

FSEUP <- exp(G$fit + 1.96 * G$se.fit)
FSELOW <- exp(G$fit - 1.96 * G$se.fit)
plot(RK$D.PARK, RK$TOT.N, 
     xlab = "Distance to the park", ylab = "Killroads")
lines(MyData$D.PARK, Fi,lty = 1)
lines(MyData$D.PARK, FSEUP, lty = 2, col = "grey")
lines(MyData$D.PARK, FSELOW, lty = 2, col = "grey")
```

## 3. Variable selection
First of all, we have to transform the variables which has outliers. We will use
a square transformation. Then, we will create a GLM model with a Poisson distribution
without interactions

```{r}
RK$SQ.POLIC <- sqrt(RK$POLIC)
RK$SQ.WATRES <- sqrt(RK$WAT.RES)
RK$SQ.LPROAD <- sqrt(RK$L.P.ROAD)
RK$SQ.SHRUB <- sqrt(RK$SHRUB)
RK$SQ.DWATCOUR <- sqrt(RK$D.WAT.COUR)

M2 <- glm(TOT.N ~ OPEN.L + MONT.S + SQ.POLIC +
          SQ.SHRUB + SQ.WATRES + L.WAT.C + SQ.LPROAD +
          SQ.DWATCOUR + D.PARK, family = poisson, data = RK)
summary(M2)
```

There are no significant variables. In order to decide which variables we have to 
eliminate we will use two kinds of selections:
1. Step method using both forward and step methods
2. Manual analysis

### 3.1. Step method
1. Forward

```{r}
summary(step(M2, trace = 0))
```

2. Drop

```{r}
drop1(M2, test = "Chi")
```

We should eliminate the SQ.DWATCOUR variable.

```{r}
M2b<-glm(TOT.N~OPEN.L + MONT.S + SQ.POLIC +
           SQ.SHRUB + SQ.WATRES + L.WAT.C + SQ.LPROAD+
           D.PARK, family = poisson, data = RK)
summary(M2b)
```

Now all the variables are statiscally significants.

### 3.2. Manual analysis

```{r}
anova(M2, M2b, test = "Chi")
```

There are no significant differences between the two models (p=0.132, Dif deviance=2.269) 
We will continue our analysis with the model without the SQ.DWATCOUR variable, since
this is the most parsimonious model.

```´r
M3 <- glm(TOT.N ~ MONT.S + SQ.POLIC + D.PARK +
            SQ.SHRUB + SQ.WATRES + L.WAT.C + SQ.LPROAD +
            SQ.DWATCOUR, family = poisson, data = RK)
anova(M2, M3, test = "Chi")
```

## 4- Overdispersion
This problem happens when the variance is greater than the mean. A value greater than
1 would mean a problem.

```{r}
270.23/42
```

## 5- Validation

```{r}
op <- par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(M2b)

EP <- resid(M2b, type = "pearson")
ED <- resid(M2b, type = "deviance")
par(op)

mu <- predict(M2b, type = "response")
E <- RK$TOT.N - mu
EP2 <- E/sqrt(6.337209 * mu)

op <- par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(x = mu, y = E, main = "Response residuals")
plot(x = mu, y = EP, main = "Pearson residuals")
plot(x = mu, y = EP2, main = "Pearson residuals scaled")
plot(x = mu, y = ED, main = "Deviance residuals")
par(op)
```

We observe an anormal ditribution of the residuals. Probably this is due to the
overdispersion problem. We try to fix it with another distribution: the negative binomial.


# Binomial negative distribution

## 1- Model creation

```{r}
library(MASS)
M6 <- glm.nb(TOT.N ~ OPEN.L + MONT.S + SQ.POLIC +
             SQ.SHRUB + SQ.WATRES + L.WAT.C + SQ.LPROAD +
             SQ.DWATCOUR + D.PARK, link = "log", data = RK)
summary(M6, cor = FALSE)
```

## 2- Variables selection
### 2.1. Step method

```{r}
summary(step(M6, trace = 0))
summary(stepAIC(M6, trace = 0))
```

Both methods suggets the variables OPEN.L, L.WAT.C, SQ.LPROAD y D.PARK. The variable SQ.LPROAD is not significant and L.WAT.C is slightly significant. 

### 2.2. Drop method

```{r}
M7 <- glm.nb(TOT.N ~ OPEN.L + L.WAT.C + SQ.LPROAD + D.PARK, link = "log", data = RK)
drop1(M7, test = "Chi")
```

We should eliminate both variables to improve our model.

### 2.3. Manual analysis

```{r}
M7b <- glm.nb(TOT.N ~ OPEN.L + L.WAT.C + D.PARK,link = "log", data = RK)
M7c <- glm.nb(TOT.N ~ OPEN.L + D.PARK, link = "log", data = RK)
anova(M7b, M7c)
```

## 3- Overdispersion

```{r}
summary(M7c)
51.839/49
```

Close to 1, so it is not supposed to be a problem.


## 4- Validation

```{r}
M8 <- glm.nb(TOT.N ~ OPEN.L + D.PARK, link = "log", data = RK)
summary(M8)
drop1(M8, test = "Chi")
```

Both variables are significant.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(M8)
```

There is no problem with the model.

## 5- Interpretation
The farther from the park (D.PARK), the lesser the number of roadkills (TOT.N).
In addition to this, the open spaces (OPEN.L) are significantly the safest.
