Hi! My name is David. I'm a data analyst from Spain but currently I'm living in Tokyo. I excel at R language, which is my favorite programming language and the thing I enjoy the most is to create plots to make easy things that would be hard to understand otherwise. 

You can find more information about me on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-valls-lan%C3%A0quera-00079477/) or contact with me via email at *dvallslanaquera@gmail.com*.
